# Medical accounting

Medical accounting is a app for patients accounting.

## Details

In this app I created the editable lists of militaries, where you can add and remove militaries and add medical history for each patient. You can see the total number of visits to medical facilities for each category. Also this app can work in offline, because I save the changed data to `Local Storage`.

## Study

I continue to study React and its environment,
therefore, I used some libraries:

- `Redux Toolkit`
- `moment.js`
- `React Router Dom`
- `Styled Components`
- `Ant designe`
